# Prolog-Pathfinder
Run this using SWI Prolog 7.6+ or it won't work!
This was originally coursework for one of my year 2 AI modules.
Decided to upload it as it was a big learning experience for me in adapting to a new type of coding.

The first half is a knowledge base, mapping out the environment our agent needs to navigate through.
To do this I essentially turned the world into a graph, giving each movement a cost. 
This way in the second half, I can run different types of searching algorithms to find the shortest paths from one node to another.
